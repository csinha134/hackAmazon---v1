# âœ¨ Consistency and Scalability

## Consistency

The application will achieve consistency by using the following mechanisms:

* **Versioning:** All data in the application will be versioned. This will ensure that all changes to data are tracked and can be rolled back if necessary.
* **Replication:** All data in the application will be replicated across multiple servers. This will ensure that data is still available even if one server fails.
* **Eventual consistency:** The application will use eventual consistency for the smart eco-chatter. This means that updates to the smart eco-chatter may not be immediately reflected to all users. However, updates will be propagated to all users within a reasonable amount of time.

## Scalability

The application will be scalable by using the following mechanisms:

* **Microservices architecture:** The application will be implemented as a microservices architecture. This means that the application will be broken down into small, independent services. Each service will be responsible for a specific task. This will make the application easier to scale and maintain.
* **Cloud-based deployment:** The application will be deployed to AWS. AWS provides a variety of scalable services, such as AWS Ec2, CloudWatch, etc. This will allow the application to scale horizontally and vertically.
* **Load balancing:** The application will use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers. This will ensure that the application can handle large volumes of traffic.



Overall, the application will be designed to be both consistent and scalable. The application will use a variety of mechanisms to achieve consistency and scalability, such as versioning, replication, eventual consistency, microservices architecture, cloud-based deployment, and load balancing.

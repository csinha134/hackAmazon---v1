# ðŸ”Œ Plug 'n' Play Architecture

## Solution architecture idea

The application will be a cloud-based application that is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The application will consist of the following components:

* **Sustainability Algorithm microservice:** This algorithm will be used to recommend sustainable alternatives for products. The algorithm will take into account a variety of factors, such as the environmental impact of the product, the social impact of the product, and the economic impact of the product.
* **Google Cloud Vision API:** Google Cloud Vision will be used to scan products and identify them. Once a product has been identified, the sustainability algorithm will be used to recommend sustainable alternatives.
* &#x20;**LLM API**: ChatGPT will be used to power the smart eco-chatter. The smart eco-chatter will be able to answer user questions about sustainable products and provide them with information about the environmental impact of the products.
* **Amazon Extension:** The Amazon extension will allow users to access the sustainability algorithm and the smart eco-chatter from within Amazon.

## Component Details

**Sustainability Algorithm:** The sustainability algorithm will be implemented as a Python microservice. The microservice will be hosted on AWS Lambda. The microservice will be exposed as a REST API.

**Google Cloud Vision:** Google Cloud Vision will be used to scan products and identify them. The Google Cloud Vision API will be integrated with the sustainability algorithm microservice.

**ChatGPT:** ChatGPT will be used to power the smart eco-chatter. The ChatGPT model will be exposed as a REST API.

**Amazon Extension:** The Amazon extension will be implemented as a Chrome extension. The Chrome extension will integrate with the sustainability algorithm microservice and the ChatGPT model.

# Read Me - Installation Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running both the frontend and backend components of your application. Make sure to follow these steps in the order provided to ensure a successful installation.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the installation, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

## Frontend Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the frontend files. Then, execute the following command to clone the repository:

git clone <frontend-repo-url>
```

Replace `<frontend-repo-url>` with the URL of your frontend repository.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Frontend Directory
Change your current working directory to the cloned frontend directory:
